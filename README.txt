### Titanic Survival Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the survival or death of passengers aboard the Titanic ship using machine learning algorithms.

#### Libraries Used:
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: A Python plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: A data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
- **numpy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, providing support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions.
- **pandas**: A fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and manipulation library.
- **sklearn.model_selection**: Provides functions to split data into training and testing sets.
- **sklearn.impute**: Offers classes for imputing missing values in datasets.
- **sklearn.preprocessing**: Provides utilities for scaling, transforming, and encoding data.
- **sklearn.ensemble**: Implements ensemble learning methods, such as random forests.
- **sklearn.neighbors**: Implements the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.
- **sklearn.tree**: Implements decision tree algorithms.
- **sklearn.svm**: Implements Support Vector Machine algorithms.
- **xgboost**: A scalable and accurate implementation of gradient boosting machines.
- **sklearn.metrics**: Provides various metrics for evaluating machine learning models.
- **sklearn.model_selection**: Offers tools for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

#### Dataset:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com). It includes the following columns:
- **Survived**: Indicates whether the passenger survived (1) or not (0).
- **Pclass**: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
- **Name**: Passenger's name.
- **Sex**: Passenger's gender.
- **Age**: Passenger's age.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard.
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Passenger's fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
